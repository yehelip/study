# Cardinal Nubmers
Cardinal numbers are the "numbers" we use to represent the cardinality of sets.  
All cardinal numbers are based on the size of ℕ　that is ℵ0  

This subject is rather simple, yet hard to invent from zero.  
Thus I encourage you to try to/look for proofs for the following:
- |ℕ|＜|ℝ|(remember when comparing cardinals that they're not numbers and only represent sizes of sets)
- ℵ0 = ℵ0+N＝ℵ0ｘｎ＝ℵ0ｘℵ0＝|ℤ|＝|ℚ|
- ℵ＝２＾ℵ0＝|｛０，１｝＾ｎ|＝ℵｘℵ0＝ℵｘℵ＝（０，１）＝\[０，１\]
- A plane can't be covered by ℵ0 lines.
- Let A be an infinte set, ∃S⊆A : |A|＝ℵ0
- ℵ＝P(ℕ)＝P(ℚ)
- let A = {The set of all finite subsets of ℕ}、|A|＝ℵ0
- ℵ＾ℵ0＝ℵ
- |ℝ＾ℝ|＝P（ℝ）＝２＾ℵ
- |The disjoint union of ℕ sets of size ℕ|=　ℵ0
- ℵ0＾ℵ0＝ℵ
- |The set of all invertible functions ℝ ↦ ℝ|=２＾ℵ
- |A| = |The set of all algebric numbers| =　ℵ0
- |B| = |ℝ\A| = |The set of all transcedental numbers| = ℵ
- |All subsets of R with cardinality ℵ0/ℵ|
