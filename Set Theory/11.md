# Ordinals
Ordinals are the generalization of ordinal numerals aimed to extend enumeration to infinite sets.  
The finite ordinals will be defined as such  
k = ord({0,1,2,..,k-1})=ord(I_ℕ(k)).  
ord(∅)=0  
and ord(ℕ)=ω  
We know that with comparing wosets there are three options and we'll define orders on the ordinals as such  
- A≅B - card(A)=a=b=card(B)
- A<B - a<b
- B<A - b<a

Define W(α) = {β：β＜α}
- W(α) is a woset and ord(W(α))＝α
- every set of ordinals is a woset

The set of all ordinals cannot be a set. Suppose it were a set - O
ord(O)∈O ∧　W(O)⊆O, ord(W(O))=ord(O) which means O is isomorphic to its Risha which can't be. This is known as the Burali-Forti paradox.

Russell's Paradox - Let R be the set than contains all the sets that don't contain themselves.  
- If R contains itself, it must not contain itself.
- If R doesn't contain itself, then it must contain itself.

There are two kinds of ordinals  
1. **Successor Ordinals -** ordinals that immediatly success another ordinal  
2. **Limit Ordinals -** the rest.
