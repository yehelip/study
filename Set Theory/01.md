# Permutations

Permutation σ is a bijection A ↦ A  
A permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint cycles(orbits)  
Those orbits define the permutation so one can write σ = (1)(2 3)(456) to define the permutation:
σ（1,2,3,4,5,6）=(1,3,2,6,4,5).  
1. (1) is considered a **fixed point** of the permutation  
2. A permutation without fixed points is called a **derangement**  
3. A permutation that's an orbit of 2 elements is call a **transposition**  
## Sn - The Symmetric Group

All the permutations on a set and the operation of function composition ```∘``` form the symmetric group.  
**Reminder** - A group is an algebric structure with the following charachteristics:
- Closure
- Associativity
- An Idenentity permutation exists
- ∀σ∈Sn　∃π：σ ∘ π＝Id)

# Hall's theorem -   

In a finite bipartite graph G(X, Y, E):  
```∀W⊆X |Ng(W)|≧|W| ⇔　An X-perfect matching exists.```  
----------------------
**PROOF:**  
Suppose S,T are the vertice groups of X,Y in the matching M  
Assume S'=X\S≠∅　⇒　∃u∈S'  
P = (u,v2,v3,...) such that:
- odd edges are not in M
- even edges are in M

A = {V:V∈X∩P(any p)}  
B = Ng(A)  
since G is bipartite if ∃ｖ∈B∧ｖ⊄M then （u,v）∪ M is a better matching ⇒ contradition  

⇒　|A|=|A-S'|+|S'|≧|Ng(A)|+|S'|>|Ng(A)| ⇒ contradition
