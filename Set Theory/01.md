# Permutations

Permutation σ is a bijection A ↦ A  
## Sn - the symmetric group -

All the permutations on a set and the operation of function composition ```∘``` form the symmetric group.  
**Reminder** - A group is an algebric structure with the following charachteristics:  
- Closure
- Associativity
- An Idenentity permutation exists
- ∀σ∈Sn　∃π：σ ∘ π＝Id)

# Hall's theorem -   

In a finite bipartite graph G(X,Y,E):  
```∀W⊆X |Ng(W)|≧|W| ⇔　An X-perfect matching exists.```  
PROOF:  

Suppose S,T are the vertice groups of X,Y in the matching M  
Assume S'=X\S≠∅　⇒　∃u∈S'  
P = (u,v2,v3,...) such that:
- odd edges are not in M  
- even edges are in M  

A = {V:V∈X∩P(any p)}  
B = Ng(A)  
since G is bipartite if ∃ｖ∈B　∧　ｖ⊄M then　（u,v）∪ M is a better matching ⇒ contradition  
⇒　|A|=|A-S'|+|S'|≧|Ng(A)|+|S'|>|Ng(A)| ⇒ contradition
