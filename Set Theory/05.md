# Partial Orders
A **Weak/Non-Strict** Partial Order is a homogeneous relation ≦ on a set P that is:
- Reflexive
- Transitive
- Antisymmetric (∀(ｘ，ｙ)、(ｙ，ｘ)∈≦　ー＞ｘ＝ｙ)

A **Strong/Strict** Partial Order is a homogeneous relation ≦ on a set P that is:
- Irreflexive
- Transitive
- Asymmetric (∀(ｘ，ｙ)∈≦　ー＞(y , x)∉≦)

```notice/prove that <∪Ir(identity relation)＝≦```

# Partially Ordered Set
A Partially Ordered Set(aka poset) is a set on which a partial order is defined (A,≦)  
2 elements a,b are comparable iff (a,b)∈≦∨(b,a)∈≦  
```if a two elements are incomparable they're non-linearly dependent```
A linear/total order is a partial order under which every pair of elements is comparable  
All ordered subsets(aka chain/שרשרת) are non-linearly dependent.  

# Extrema
- **Greatest Element** - an element that's comparable and greater than all other elements  
- **Maximal Element** - an element that doesn't have a greater element of him  
- **Upper/Lower Bounds in sets** - a Bound a in A of B⊆A　∀ｂ∈B、a≧b  
```What are bounds of ∅？∅　has an infimum iff ???```

### About Latices
Let A be a partially ordered set:
- ∀S⊆A：|S|＝２、InfS、SupS exist ⇔ A is a ```סריג```
- ∀S⊆A　、InfS∧SupS exist ⇔ A is a ```סריג מלא```
