# Equivalence relations  
An equivalence relation is a binary relation(a set of ordered pairs) that is  
- Reflexive  
- Symmetric  
- Transitive  

Some terminology
- **Equivalnece Class**  
`[a]` = {x∈X : a~ｘ}
- **Quotient set**  
X/~　ー　The set of all Equivalence classes  
- **Projection**  
The projection of ~ is π：X ↦ X/~  
π（ｘ）＝`[a]`  
- **Cut(חתך)** - A set with only one element of each Equivalence class.  

Equivalence relations can be defined by their Quotient set.  
Thus they can also be defined by a function or a partition.  

```The number of partitions is hard to type here but using a recursive relation we can write Bn+1 = ∑C(n,k)Bk(0 to n)```
