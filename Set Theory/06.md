# Schröder–Bernstein theorem
|A|≦|B|∧|A|≧|B|　⇔　|A|＝|B|
------------------
There are more proofs that rely on similiar ideas. Here's one:  
PROOF:  
Wer'e given two injective functions f:A ↦ B g:B ↦ A
Without loss of generality assume A,B are disjoint(Why can we do this?)  
For each a∈A b∈B　we'll define a sequence as such:  
```...g⁻¹(a)->a->f(a)->g(f(a))->...```
It's simple to see that if an element appears in two sequences they will be identical  
Thus those partitions form a partition for A∪B so it's enough to find bijections in every sequence seperatly  
While a sequences may continue forever on the right, on the left it may terminate.  
If a sequence terminated on an element of:
- A -> f is a bijection for that sequence(from the elements of a to those in b on their right)
- B -> g is a bijection for that sequence
- If it doesn't terminate either will do
It's not hard to see how to get to a bijection from here by using different "parts" of A and B
