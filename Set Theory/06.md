# Schröder–Bernstein theorem
|A|≦|B|∧|A|≧|B|　⇔　|A|＝|B|
------------------
There are more proofs that rely on similiar ideas. Here's one:  

We're given two injective functions  
f:A ↦ B  
g:B ↦ A  
Without loss of generality assume A,B are disjoint(Why can we do this?)  
For each a∈A b∈B　we'll define a sequence as such:  
```...g⁻¹(a)->a->f(a)->g(f(a))->...```  
It's simple to see that if an element appears in two sequences they will be identical.  
Thus, those sequences form a partition we'll call P for A∪B  
While a sequence may continue forever on the right, on the left it may terminate since f⁻¹,g⁻¹ are not necessarily defined on all of B,A   
∀ｐ∈P if P terminates on an element of
- A -> f is a bijection for the elements of A,B in P
//f takes the elements of A in the sequence to those in B on their right
- B -> g is a bijection for the elements of A,B in P
- If it doesn't terminate either f or g will do
It's not hard to see how to get to a bijection from here by using those bijections
