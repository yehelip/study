# Axiom of Choice
First let's define what is a choice function.
**A Choice Function -** is a function from an indexed family of sets (Si)i∈I to such that ∀i∈I(f(Si)∈Si)
Now for the axiom itself-  
**The Axiom of Choice -** ```∀S「∅∉S⇒∃f:S ↦ US　∀A∈S(f(A)∈A)」```
Nomenclature:  
- AC - Axiom of Choice
- ZF Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory omitting AC
- ZFC ZF extended to include AC
