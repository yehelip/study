# Homomorphism and Isomorphosm of Ordered Sets

## Homomorphisms
Let (X,≦₁) , (Y,≦₂) be partially ordered sets.  
F is a Homomorphism iff
- ∀x₁,x₂∈X x₁≦x₂ ⇒ F(x₁)≦F(x₂)  

## Isomorphism
Let (X,≦₁) , (Y,≦₂) be partially ordered sets.  
F is an Isomorphism iff  
- F is a bijection from X to Y
- ∀x₁,x₂∈X x₁≦x₂ ⇔ F(x₁)≦F(x₂)
Isomorphism is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive ⇒ It's an **equivalence relation**  
If f is an isomorphism and the order is linear/total then f⁻¹ is also an isomorphism.  

# Lexicographic Order
Also known as a Dictonary Order, is an order That's defined as such:  
```(x₁,y₁)≦l(x₂,y₂)⇔ x₁<x x₂ ∨ (y₁≦y y₂ ∧ x₁=x₂)```
This is a partial order on XｘY.
